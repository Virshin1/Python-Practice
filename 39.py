This program simulates a swarm of particles moving in a bounded space. The particles have random positions and velocities, and they bounce off the boundaries of the space. The program uses object-oriented programming, incorporates random number generation, and includes error handling. The main functionality is the simulation of the swarm, which is implemented in the `update` method of the `Swarm` class, where each particle's position and velocity are updated. The `draw` method of the `Swarm` class is intended to visualize the swarm, and the `Particle` class represents an individual particle with its own position, velocity, and radius. This program is a creative and unique implementation of a swarm simulation, different from standard programming tasks or common examples.
